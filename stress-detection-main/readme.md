# Image (spectrogram) & Biosignal Analysis for Stress Detection

This repo contains a segment of codes for Leonidas Liakopoulos Undergraduate Thesis. Repo has been organized taking into account the 2 main axes of implementation:

 - Biosignal Analysis from different sensory systems, preprocesing, training and evaluation.
 - Spectrogramm Generation from HR Signal and Classification using CNN.


Each of these main segments are using specific datasets. For the 1st experiment, user should download SWELL and for the 2nd experiment, WESAD. These are neseccary in order to use preprocessing tools that are provided.
